# Mood Mixr

Our program provides Spotify users with a personalized listening experience relating to a list of factors specified 
by the user. 

Users can create a mood by selecting attributes or choosing a public playlist for the program to analyze and create 
a new mood with the average audio features. The program can generate a playlist based on the user's selected mood, 
taking into account the user's top tracks. The program can also create a new playlist by grouping together 
pre-existing playlists chosen by the user.
